# 👋 Hello there!

This is my personal portfolio website where you can get to know me better.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I created this portfolio to showcase myself, my projects, and my journey as a fresh Computer Science graduate. At the same time, I wanted to learn and experiment with **Alpine.js** and **Tailwind CSS** - two technologies I've been curious about.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Alpine.js** - For interactive features
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
